# Wallet

Stellar wallet integration for TalentTrust. Manages connection state globally via React Context and exposes UI components for connecting, displaying, and collecting wallet addresses.

**Sources:**
- `src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx` — provider, hook, and type definitions
- `src/components/WalletConnectButton.tsx` — primary connect/disconnect UI
- `src/components/WalletAddressInput.tsx` — validated address form field
- `src/app/wallet/page.tsx` — wallet page composing the above

---

> ⚠️ **Mock implementation notice**
>
>
> $connect()$ is **currently mocked**. It simulates a 1-second delay and resolves with the
> hard-coded $MOCKED_STELLAR_ADDRESS$ constant. No real wallet extension is contacted.
> The public API will remain unchanged when real Freighter integration lands; only the
> internals of $connect()$ will change.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Mount the provider

WalletProvider` is already wired at the root in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Place it inside
`ToastProvider` so it can dispatch toast notifications:

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
import { WalletProvider } from '@/contexts/WalletContext';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <PreferencesProvider>
          <ToastProvider>
            <WalletProvider idleTimeout={900_000}>
              {children}
            </WalletProvider>
          </ToastProvider>
        </PreferencesProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 2. Drop in the connect button

```tsx
import { WalletConnectButton } from '@/components/WalletConnectButton';

export function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <WalletConnectButton />
    </header>
  );
}
```

### 3. Read wallet state in any client component

```tsx
'use client';
import { useWallet } from '@/contexts/WalletContext';

export function PayButton() {
  const { address, connect } = useWallet();

  if (!address) {
    return <button onClick={connect}>Connect wallet to pay</button>;
  }

  return <button>Pay from {address.slice(0, 6)}…</button>;
}
```

---

## Provider: $WalletProvider$

```tsx
<WalletProvider idleTimeout={900_000}>
  {children}
</WalletProvider>
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| $children$ | $ReactNode$ | — | React subtree that requires wallet context. |
| $idleTimeout$ | $number$ | $preferences.idleDisconnectMs$ | Inactivity duration in milliseconds before the session auto-disconnects. $0$ disables the feature. When omitted, falls back to the value stored in $PreferencesProvider$. |

### Provider placement

WalletProvider` must be a descendant of both `PreferencesProvider` (for the `idleDisconnectMs`
default) and `ToastProvider` (for connection-failure and session-expired notifications):

```
RootLayout
└── PreferencesProvider
└── ToastProvider
└── WalletProvider   ← here
└── {children}
```

### Idle auto-disconnect

When $idleTimeout > 0$ and a wallet is connected, the provider attaches passive listeners for
$pointermove$, $keydown$, $visibilitychange$, $mousedown$, and $touchstart$. If none of these
events fires within $idleTimeout$ ms, $disconnect()$ is called automatically and a
_"Session expired"_ toast is shown. The timer resets on each activity event and is fully cleaned
up on unmount.

Recommended production value: $900_000$ (15 minutes).

---

## Hook: $useWallet$

```tsx
const { address, isConnecting, error, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();
```

Must be called inside a <WalletProvider> subtree. Throws
`y"useWallet must be used within a WalletProvider"` if called outside one.

### Return value ($WalletContextType$)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `address` | `string \ | null` | Connected Stellar public key (G-address), or `null`. Rehydrated from `localStorage` on mount so it survives page refreshes. |
| `isConnecting` | `boolean` | `true` while a connection attempt is in flight. Use to disable the connect button and show a spinner. |
| `error` | `string \ | null` | Human-readable error from the most recent failed `connect()` call, or `null`. Cleared automatically at the start of each new attempt. |
| `connect` | `() => Promise<void>` | Initiates a connection attempt. Always resolves; errors are surfaced via `error` and an accessible error toast, never via rejection. |
| `disconnect` | `() => void` | Clears `address`, removes `wallet_connected_address` from `localStorage`, and cancels any running idle timer. |

### $connect()$ state transitions

1. Sets $isConnecting → true$, clears $error → null$.
2. Attempts to connect (currently mocked with a 1-second delay).
3. **Success:** sets $address$ and persists to $localStorage$.
4. **Failure:** sets $error$ and fires a $showError$ toast.
5. Sets $isConnecting → false$ in all cases (via $finally$).

### Known error constants

| Constant | Value | Cause |
|----------|-------|-------|
| $FREIGHTER_NOT_INSTALLED$ | $"Freighter wallet is not installed. Please install the Freighter browser extension."$ | Browser extension not detected. |
| $USER_REJECTED$ | $"User rejected the connection request."$ | User dismissed the Freighter approval popup. |

Both are exported from $src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx$x.

### Example

```tsx
'use client';
import { useWallet } from '@/contexts/WalletContext';

export function ConnectButton() {
  const { address, isConnecting, error, connect, disconnect } = useWallet();

  if (isConnecting) return <p aria-live="polite">Connecting…</p>;

  if (error) {
    return (
      <div role="alert">
        <p>Connection error: {error}</p>
        <button onClick={connect}>Retry</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  if (address) {
    return (
      <button onClick={disconnect}>
        Disconnect ({address.slice(0, 6)}…)
      </button>
    );
  }

  return <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>;
}
```

---

## Component: $WalletConnectButton$

```tsx
import { WalletConnectButton } from '@/components/WalletConnectButton';

<WalletConnectButton />
```

Self-contained UI for the full connect/disconnect lifecycle. Requires no props — it reads
all state from `useWallet()` internally. Depends on both `WalletProvider` and `ToastProvider`
`being present in the tree.

### Props

None. This component is fully self-contained.

### Rendered branches

| State | Rendered output |
|-------|-----------------|
| Disconnected | "Connect Wallet" button (`aria-label="Connect wallet"`). |
| Connecting | Disabled button with animated spinner and "Connecting…" text. |
| Error | Red banner with "Connection Error" label and a "Retry" link ($aria-label="Retry wallet connection"$). |
| Connected | Address pill (truncated via $truncateAddress$), copy button ($aria-label="Copy address to clipboard"$), and disconnect button ($aria-label="Disconnect wallet"$). |

### Clipboard copy behaviour

The copy button uses $navigator.clipboard.writeText$. Failures surface as error toasts rather
than console logs (the address is treated as sensitive data):

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Success | Checkmark icon; reverts to copy icon after 2 s. |
| $navigator.clipboard$ absent | Error toast: "Copy not supported". |
| $writeText$ absent | Error toast: "Copy not supported". |
| $writeText$ rejects (e.g. permission denied) | Error toast: "Copy failed". |

---

## Component: $WalletAddressInput$

```tsx
import { WalletAddressInput } from '@/components/WalletAddressInput';

<WalletAddressInput
  id="recipient"
  label="Recipient address"
  value={address}
  onChange={setAddress}
/>
```

A validated Stellar address input field. Wraps $FormField$ and validates on blur using
$isValidStellarAddress$ from $src/lib/stellarAddress.ts$. Normalizes the value to uppercase
on blur to match on-chain representation.

### Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | ✓ | — | `id` for the `<input>` and its associated `<label>`. |
| `label` | `string` | ✓ | — | Visible label text. Also used in generated error messages. |
| `value` | `string` | ✓ | — | Controlled input value. |
| `onChange` | `(value: string) => void` | ✓ | — | Called on every keystroke with the raw input value, and on blur with the normalized (uppercased) value if it changed. |
| `error` | `string` | — | `undefined` | External error message from the parent form (e.g. submit-time validation). Takes precedence over any internally generated blur error. |
| `helperText` | `string` | — | `undefined` | Supplemental hint displayed below the input. |
| `required` | `boolean` | — | `undefined` | Marks the field as required visually and semantically. Triggers a `'${label} is required'` error on blur when the value is empty. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | — | `"GXXXXXXXX…"` | Input placeholder text. |
| `onValidation` | `(fieldId: string, error: string \ | null) => void` | — | `undefined` | Called after every blur with the validation result. Use to feed errors into a parent `ErrorSummary`. |

### Validation rules (applied on blur)

| Condition | Error message |
|-----------|--------------|
| Empty value and `required={true}` | `" ${label} is required"` |
| Non-empty value fails `isValidStellarAddress` | `" ${label} must be a valid Stellar G... address"` |
| Valid address | No error; value is normalized to uppercase. |

### Accessibility

$WalletAddressInput$ inherits the full accessibility wiring from $FormField$:
- $<label>$ linked by $id$.
- $aria-invalid="true$ on the $<input>$ when an error is present.
- $aria-describedby$ pointing to the helper text and error message paragraphs.
- Error paragraph uses $role="alert$$ for immediate screen-reader announcement.

### Example — form with submit validation

```tsx
'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { WalletAddressInput } from '@/components/WalletAddressInput';

export function SendForm() {
  const [recipient, setRecipient] = useState('');
  const [fieldErrors, setFieldErrors] = useState<Record<string, string | null>>({});

  const handleValidation = (fieldId: string, error: string | null) => {
    setFieldErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, [fieldId]: error }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // fieldErrors.recipient will be populated by blur validation
    if (fieldErrors.recipient) return;
    // proceed with recipient address…
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <WalletAddressInput
        id="recipient"
        label="Recipient address"
        value={recipient}
        onChange={setRecipient}
        required
        helperText="Enter the full 56-character Stellar public key."
        onValidation={handleValidation}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Page: `src/app/wallet/page.tsx`

The wallet page is the top-level entry point for wallet connection and address collection.
It owns the **validation boundaries** for address input before any value leaves the page.

### Responsibilities

- Renders `WalletConnectButton` and `WalletAddressInput`.
- Holds the controlled address state and the field-level error map.
- Enforces the validation boundaries described below on submit.
- Prevents duplicate and concurrent submissions from producing inconsistent state.

### Validation boundaries

Every address entering the page is classified into exactly one of the following categories.
The categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive; the order below is the order in
which they are applied.

| Order | Category | Condition | Result |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Empty | Trimmed value is an empty string | Rejected with `"Recipient address is required"`. No submit is attempted. |
| 2 | Malformed | Trimmed value fails `isValidStellarAddress` | Rejected with `"Recipient address must be a valid Stellar G... address"`. No submit is attempted. |
| 3 | Duplicate | The normalized address equals the last successfully submitted address within the same page session | Rejected with `"Recipient address has already been submitted"`. No submit is attempted. |
| 4 | Boundary | Trimmed value is exactly 56 characters and passes `isValidStellarAddress` | Accepted. Normalized to uppercase before being handled. |
| 5 | Valid | Trimmed value passes `isValidStellarAddress` and is not a duplicate | Accepted. Normalized to uppercase before being handled. |

### Invariants

1. **Normalization is idempotent.** Applying trim + uppercase twice yields the same result as
applying it once. This makes duplicate detection deterministic regardless of how the user
capitalized the input.
2. **Validation precedes mutation.** No state change occurs until all five categories have been
evaluated. A failed validation leaves the previous state untouched.
3. **Submission is serialized.** At most one submission is in flight at any time. A second
submit while one is in flight is a no-op.
4. **Duplicate recording happens on success only.** The last-submitted address is updated only
after the submission resolves successfully, so a failed submission can be retried with the
same address.
5. **Errors are non-sensitive.** Error messages never echo the full address. They refer to the
field by label only.

### State model

```tsx
interface WalletPageState {
  /** Raw controlled input value, exactly as typed by the user. */
  recipient: string;
  /** Per-field validation messages keyed by field id. */
  fieldErrors: Record<string, string | null>;
  /** True while a submission is in flight; guards against concurrent submits. */
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  /** Normalized address of the last successful submit, or null. */
  lastSubmittedAddress: string | null;
}
```

### State transitions

```
IDILE
  └─ submit()
       ├─ validation fails → fieldErrors updated, stay in IDLE
       └─ validation passes → SUBMITTING

SUBMITTING
  └─ await resolves
       ├─ success → lastSubmittedAddress updated → IDLE
       └─ failure → fieldErrors updated, lastSubmittedAddress unchanged → IDLE
```

### Example

```tsx
'use client';
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react';
import { WalletAddressInput } from '@/components/WalletAddressInput';
import { isValidStellarAddress } from '@/lib/stellarAddress';

export default function WalletPage() {
  const [recipient, setRecipient] = useState('');
  const [fieldErrors, setFieldErrors = useState<Record<string, string | null>>({});
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [lastSubmittedAddress, setLastSubmittedAddress] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const normalize = (value: string) => value.trim().toUpperCase();

  const validate = useCallback((value: string): string | null => {
    const normalized = normalize(value);
    if (!normalized) return 'Recipient address is required';
    if (!isValidStellarAddress(normalized)) {
      return 'Recipient address must be a valid Stellar G... address';
    }
    if (normalized === lastSubmittedAddress) {
      return 'Recipient address has already been submitted';
    }
    return null;
  }, [lastSubmittedAddress]);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (isSubmitting) return;
    const error = validate(recipient);
    if (error) {
      setFieldErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, recipient: error }));
      return;
    }
    setFieldErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, recipient: null }));
    setIsSubmitting(true);
    try {
      // call the address-consuming action here
      setLastSubmittedAddress(normalize(recipient));
    } catch {
      setFieldErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, recipient: 'Submission failed. Please retry.' }));
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
      <WalletAddressInput
        id="recipient"
        label="Recipient address"
        value={recipient}
        onChange={setRecipient}
        error={fieldErrors.recipient ?? undefined}
        required
        onValidation={(fieldId, error) =>
          setFieldErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, [fieldId]: error }))
        }
      />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting…' : 'Send'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Observability

- Rejections are surfaced through the field error paragraph (`role="alert"`) and the
parent `ErrorSummary` via `onValidation`.
- Submission failures set a generic field error that does not include the address.
- Never log the full address to the console or to any analytics sink.

### Test coverage

Focused tests for the page live in `src/app/wallet/page.test.tsx` and cover:

| Scenario | Expected outcome |
|----------|------------------|
| Accepted input | Valid 56-char G-address submits and records the normalized address. |
| Rejected input | Empty and malformed addresses set a field error and do not submit. |
| Duplicate submission | Submitting the same normalized address twice is rejected the second time. |
| Boundary values | 55-char and 57-char inputs are rejected; 56-char input is accepted. |
| Concurrent submit | A double click on submit only invokes the action once. |
| Regression | A valid address with lowercase letters is accepted and normalized to uppercase. |

---

## Session persistence

The connected address is stored in `localStorage` under the key `wallet_connected_address`.
On mount, the provider rehydrates the address from this key so it survives page refreshes.
Disconnecting removes the key and clears in-memory state.

---

## State invariants (`src/app/wallet/page.tsx`)

The wallet page owns the following invariants. They are enforced in code and covered by
focused tests.

### I/1 — Single in-flight connection

At most one `connect()` attempt may be in flight at a time. Repeated or concurrent invocations
(double-click, keyboard repeat, React StrictMode double-invoke, programmatic calls) are
coalesced into the existing promise rather than starting a second attempt. This prevents
out-of-order resolutions from clobbering `address` or `isConnecting`.

### I/2 — Address is either null or a valid Stellar G-address

Whenever `address` becomes non-null, it must satisfy `isValidStellarAddress`. The
provider validates any candidate address before committing it to state or persisting it to
`localStorage`. If the address is invalid, the attempt fails with a diagnosable error and
no state change occurs.

### I/3 — Persistence is atomic with state

The `wallet_connected_address` key in `localStorage` is written only after the in-memory
address has been accepted, and removed on disconnect. If `localStorage` is unavailable or
throws (e.g. private browsing, quota exceeded), the in-memory session still succeeds and the
failure is reported through the error channel — no silent data loss.

### I/4 — Disconnect is idempotent and cancels pending work

Calling `disconnect()` when already disconnected is a no-op. Calling it while a connection is in
flight marks the attempt as cancelled so the eventual resolution of the in-flight promise does
not re-attach an address. This prevents a stale connection from resurrecting after the user
has explicitly disconnected.

### I/5 — Idle timeout cannot fire while disconnected or connecting

The idle timer is armed only when `address !== null` and `isConnecting === false`. The
timer is cleared on disconnect, on connect start, and on unmount. A timeout fire that coincides
with a new connect attempt is suppressed.

### I/6 — Errors are non-fatal and observable

`connect()` always resolves (it never rejects). Failures set `error` to a human-readable,
sanitized message and emit an accessible toast. Raw wallet error objects, stack traces, and
addresses are never included in user-visible messages or logs.

### I/7 — Validation is deterministic for duplicate and boundary inputs

The same input always produces the same validation result. Empty values, values of the
wrong length, lowercase addresses, and duplicate submissions are all handled explicitly.
Normalization to uppercase happens once on blur and is idempotent.

---

## Testing

Focused tests live beside the implementation and cover:

- **Success path**: a valid address is committed and persisted.
- `**Rejection path**: invalid addresses and user rejection set `error` without mutating `address`.
- **Boundary cases**: empty string, wrong length, and lowercase input.
- `**Concurrency**: concurrent `connect()` calls coalesce into one attempt.
- `**Regression**: disconnect during an in-flight connect does not re-attach the address.

Run the focused suite with the repository test runner and keep the CI evidence attached to the PR.
