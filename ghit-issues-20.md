## Give contracts clear empty and error states

### Description

The contracts view renders blank when there is no data or a load fails, leaving users without guidance. This issue adds distinct, accessible empty and error states.

### Requirements and context

- **Repository scope:** Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Frontend only.
- Add an empty state and an error state (with retry) to contracts, distinct from loading.
- Announce state changes for assistive tech; reuse the existing fetch-state model.
- Keep the retry keyboard-operable.

### Suggested execution

- Fork the repo and create a branch
- `git checkout -b feature/contracts-01-states`
- Implement changes
  - **Write code in:** the relevant module.
  - **Write comprehensive tests in:** cover the new behaviour and edge cases.
- Test and commit

### Test and commit

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Cover edge cases: empty vs error vs loading exclusivity, retry re-fetches.
- Include the full test output in the PR description.

### Example commit message

`feat(contracts): add empty and error states`

### Guidelines

- **Minimum 95 percent test coverage** for impacted modules.
- Clear, reviewer-focused documentation.
- **Timeframe: 96 hours.**

### Community & contribution rewards

- 💬 **Join the TalentTrust community on Discord:** https://discord.gg/WqnGpcPx
- ⭐ This is a **GrantFox OSS / Official Campaign** task and **may be rewarded**. When your PR is merged you'll be prompted to rate the project — a **5-star rating** is much appreciated.

## Reduce wallet re-renders

### Description

The wallet view re-renders on unrelated state changes, hurting responsiveness on larger data sets. This issue memoizes the expensive parts.

### Requirements and context

- **Repository scope:** Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Frontend only.
- Memoize the derived wallet data and row rendering so unrelated state changes do not re-render it.
- Behaviour and output unchanged; verified by tests.
- No new dependencies.

### Suggested execution

- Fork the repo and create a branch
- `git checkout -b refactor/wallet-01-memoize`
- Implement changes
  - **Write code in:** the relevant module.
  - **Write comprehensive tests in:** cover the new behaviour and edge cases.
- Test and commit

### Test and commit

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Cover edge cases: large data set, filter change still updates.
- Include the full test output in the PR description.

### Example commit message

## Give navigation clear empty and error states

### Description

The navigation view renders blank when there is no data or a load fails, leaving users without guidance. This issue adds distinct, accessible empty and error states.

### Requirements and context

- **Repository scope:** Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Frontend only.
- Add an empty state and an error state (with retry) to navigation, distinct from loading.
- Announce state changes for assistive tech; reuse the existing fetch-state model.
- Keep the retry keyboard-operable.

### Suggested execution

- Fork the repo and create a branch
- `git checkout -b feature/navigation-01-states`
- Implement changes
  - **Write code in:** the relevant module.
  - **Write comprehensive tests in:** cover the new behaviour and edge cases.
- Test and commit

### Test and commit

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Cover edge cases: empty vs error vs loading exclusivity, retry re-fetches.
- Include the full test output in the PR description.

### Example commit message

`feat(navigation): add empty and error states`

### Guidelines

- **Minimum 95 percent test coverage** for impacted modules.
- Clear, reviewer-focused documentation.
- **Timeframe: 96 hours.**

## Announce navigation changes to assistive tech

### Description

When navigation content updates, screen-reader users receive no feedback. This issue adds a polite live-region announcement.

### Requirements and context

- **Repository scope:** Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Frontend only.
- Announce the meaningful navigation change (count/status) via a polite live region.
- Debounce so rapid updates do not spam the queue; do not announce on mount.
- No change to the underlying logic.

### Suggested execution

- Fork the repo and create a branch
- `git checkout -b a11y/navigation-01-live`
- Implement changes
  - **Write code in:** the relevant module.
  - **Write comprehensive tests in:** cover the new behaviour and edge cases.
- Test and commit

### Test and commit

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Cover edge cases: rapid successive updates, zero results.
- Include the full test output in the PR description.

### Example commit message

`a11y(navigation): announce updates politely`

### Guidelines

- **Minimum 95 percent test coverage** for impacted modules.
- Clear, reviewer-focused documentation.

## Document navigation

### Description

The navigation component's props and usage are undocumented, leading to inconsistent use. This issue adds a concise reference.

### Requirements and context

- **Repository scope:** Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Frontend only.
